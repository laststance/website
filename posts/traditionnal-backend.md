I miss traditional backend that server-side program + DB.  
I recently writing prisma & graphql stack that's amazing make sence, will be saving darkside from software dev.  

On the other hand I have feeling that web engineer should handle certainly server-side script + light-weight ORM + RDB stack.  

The installing above stack plain linux is funcdamental of web development.  

Serverless, full managed DB clould service getting influencing even though traditonal IaaS based infra skil are so valuable in the K8 world.
