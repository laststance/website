I'm using Pomodoro Timer while working.  
Current my using app is pretty good design and has enough feature I like it.  

But the app lacks only one feature I need.  
It's "keep achivement state of the day without reset as a next day when after 12 midnight".  

In shot that app is not working well for a night person like me.  
So I'm willing build my own app to fixing it!
