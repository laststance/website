Always I have planed next tasks.  
Always will appiering exptional tech stuff something but it's might be impoert as a developer or vice versa.  

That's one of the developer's decision making like a CEO makes desition of busines strategy,  
catch up it rather than original plan or ignore it and to do task following plan.  


I saw the post on Twitter by chance today.
[Modern Cross Browser Testing with Cypress and Applitools](https://www.mariedrake.com/post/modern-cross-browser-testing-with-cypress-and-applitools)  


After that...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve just finished watching the <a href="https://twitter.com/Cypress_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Cypress_io</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/Applitools?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Applitools</a> Hands-on video that was introduced by <a href="https://twitter.com/bahmutov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bahmutov</a> <br><br>At the second scene is insane! ðŸ˜±<a href="https://t.co/FP43JUpxWW">https://t.co/FP43JUpxWW</a></p>&mdash; Ryota Murakami (@malloc007) <a href="https://twitter.com/malloc007/status/1289886513476509696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2020</a></blockquote>

That's might be valuable out of box from plan.
