I suspect Apollo Client Refetch Query as a state management tool.  
When I send mutation and sucessed change database value, which doesn't reflect client side data & ui.  

I know Apollo Client has many configuration about cache priority and Search Results Optimistic UI.  
But it seems a bit complicated and unreliable in the sense of figuring out client-side data sources in a matter of seconds.  

This is a completely nonsense comparison, but I personally think Redux excels in reliability.
