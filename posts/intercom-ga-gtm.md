I've read [Speculation in JavaScriptCore](https://webkit.org/blog/10308/speculation-in-javascriptcore/) halfway that found in the [https://javascriptweekly.com/](https://javascriptweekly.com/).  

And today main task is Next.js & Apollo & Prisma shopsite [Wesbos](https://wesbos.com/) course.  
It was dropped in the middle but I've re-start from today,  
finaly I could catch up entire codebase and current progress enough.  

BTW I had curious what the difference between "Google Analytics" and "Google Tag Manager" I don't know why but...  

Once google about it search top result show me "Google Tag Manager is replace "Google Analytics".  
OK, that's simply modern marketing tool, right.  
But I'm not a marketing person so it's not my concern, that's it.  

BTW I still have curious about "Intercom" I don't know why but...
